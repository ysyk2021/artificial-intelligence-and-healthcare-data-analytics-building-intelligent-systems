# Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare Data Analytics: Building Intelligent Systems That Help Doctors and Patients

# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Healthcare Data Analytics are rapidly transforming the healthcare industry by providing new insights and improving patient outcomes. With advancements in medical technology and the increasing use of electronic health records, healthcare data is growing at an unprecedented rate. However, as the amount of data increases, so does the need for effective methods to manage, process, and analyze it. This is where AI and data analytics play a crucial role.

The purpose of this book is to provide an overview of how AI and data analytics can be applied in healthcare to develop intelligent systems that help doctors and patients make better decisions. The book will cover various topics related to healthcare data analytics, including data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, and will demonstrate how these technologies can be used to improve healthcare delivery.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of AI and data analytics and their significance in healthcare. We will begin by defining AI and its various subfields and discussing its applications in healthcare. We will also introduce data analytics and its different techniques, such as descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.

We will then discuss why AI and data analytics are crucial for healthcare. We will highlight some of the major challenges that healthcare faces today, such as rising costs, increasing demand, and the need for personalized care. We will explain how AI and data analytics can help address these challenges by improving diagnosis accuracy, optimizing treatment plans, reducing medical errors, and enhancing patient outcomes.

Finally, we will provide an overview of the structure of the book, highlighting the key topics covered in each chapter and explaining how they fit together to form a comprehensive understanding of AI and healthcare data analytics.

This book is intended for healthcare professionals, researchers, and students who want to understand the potential of AI and data analytics for healthcare. By the end of the book, readers will have gained a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI and data analytics and will be able to apply this knowledge to develop intelligent systems that help doctors and patients make better decisions.
